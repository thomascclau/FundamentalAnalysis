Fundamental Analysis


## Project Aims

1. Using fundamental analysis to pick stock to outperform market in the long term (>2 years)

Compare performance with Mutual Index Fund such as Vanguard



## Project Plan

(1) Getting basic Company Info, from some free online data provider

(2) Downloading earning report each quarter, and extract useful data (revenue, cost, opex, etc)

(3) Extracting any public alternative data related to the company, if available

(4) Automating finance model building with help of Python

(5) Generating reports for fundemental analyst

There are a lot of rooms of application of automation/AI/big data approach to fundamental analysis, but you need to have really good understanding of financial modeling before getting Python to help you





(1) Need to understand webscraping.

(2) Need to operate with docx/pdf/excel, as well as basic NLP for information extraction.

(3) This one is very tricky, but typically a combination of webscraping/data extraction if you are not working in institution and not buying data from vendor

(4) Financial Modeling and Valuation, here are two introductory texts:
